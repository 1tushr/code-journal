# Node.js, Express, MongoDB Blogging App

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a simple blogging app built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations with the functionality of Authentication & Authorization.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-tracking-bot.git
    ```

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a .env file in the project root and add your environment variables:**

    ```env
    PORT=your_server_port
    CONNECTION_STRING=your_mongodb_connection_string
    SECRET_TOKEN=your_secret_jwt_token
    EXPIRY_TIME=token_expiry_time
    ```

4. **Run the server locally:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    After that, you will see `Connected to MongoDB` and `Server up and running at port` followed by your port number.
